26218,1451639434378678272,2021-10-22,@tim_cook Come see the Apple Cloth ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

26905,1421245561898815492,2021-07-31,"@flcnhvy Indeed. Both Cook &amp; I have been clear publicly that we have never spoken or otherwise communicated. I tried to speak to him &amp; he declined.   Nor have I ever expressed any interest in running Apple to anyone. Cook is, all things considered, obviously doing an incredible job."
26909,1421209433519050760,2021-07-31,"@WholeMarsBlog Normally, competitive pressure would force Apple to lower fees, but Apple &amp; Android have a duopoly on phones. When interface familiarity is taken into account, it‚Äôs basically a monopoly.   The effective 30% sales tax Apple charges is hidden from users or there would be an outcry."
26912,1421203369058787332,2021-07-31,"@WholeMarsBlog Actually, I like &amp; use Apple products.   They are just obviously overcharging with App Store. I mean 30% fees for doing almost zero incremental work is completely unreasonable.   Epic wouldn‚Äôt bother processing their own payments if App Store fees were fair."
26914,1421152540394143746,2021-07-30,Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right.
26915,1421150913075503112,2021-07-30,@JamesClayton5 @markgurman @tim_cook Cook &amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever.   There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever.   He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about 6% of today‚Äôs value.
